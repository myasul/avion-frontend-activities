                        Apple Inc. — originally known as Apple Computers —
                        began
                        in
                        1976. Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak worked
                        out
                        of
                        Jobs' garage at his home in Los Altos, California.
                        On April 1, 1976, they debuted the Apple 1, a
                        desktop
                        computer that came as a single motherboard,
                        pre-assembled,
                        unlike other personal computers of that era.

                        Launched in June 1977, the Apple II was the first
                        successful mass-market PC. Jobs and Apple cofounder
                        Steve Wozniak designed the Apple II, and it changed
                        computing around the world.Unlike the earlier Apple I,
                        for which users had to supply essential parts such as a
                        case and power supply, the Apple II was a fully realized
                        consumer product.
