# Avion School Frontend Activities

Collection of all activities related to frontend programming at [Avion School](avionschool.com).

Avion School strives to make Filipino lives better by teaching them web development and kicking off their software career by landing them a job.

I'm a front-end programming instructor in Avion School and these are a few of the projects that the students will work once they start the class. I personally worked on the projects as well so that I can help and guide them efficiently when they start working on their own projects.
